"""The auto-tighten and the re-baseline: which way a recorded count may move,
and what a command may leave on disk.

Its own module because `test_journey_budget.py` is at the 700-line ceiling
and holds the SCHEMA and the gates; these two are about the writing, and
both are questions that file's existing tests do not ask. Nothing here
asserts a number the next run will refuse, and nothing asserts a wall-clock
margin: a count is a number this repository must not write down, so every
control drives a measurement handed to the module.
